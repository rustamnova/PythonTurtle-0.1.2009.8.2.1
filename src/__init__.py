An educational environment for learning Python, suitable for beginners
and children. Inspired by LOGO.

Call `run()` to run it.

PythonTurtle aims to be the most low-threshold way for learning or
teaching Python. The user is given command of an interactive Python
shell, similar to IDLE, and is able to use Python functions to move a
