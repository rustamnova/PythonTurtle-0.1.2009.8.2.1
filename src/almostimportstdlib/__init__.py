"""
This small package makes py2exe pack the entire Python 2.6.2 stdlib.
It does so by "almost" importing the entire stdlib.
To use it, just import it, and that's it:
py2exe will pack the entire stdlib with your executable.
If you want to change the list of modules, dig in
the code, it's very short.
